Perhaps we were the recipients of a Twelfth Step call. Maybe someone picked us

when we were new. All of us have been given time, attention, and love by our
fellow members. We may have asked someone, &quot;What can I do to repay
you?&quot; And the answer we received was probably a suggestion that we do the
same for a newer member when we were able.</span></p>

someone did for us, and happy that we can. If we heard the message while in a
hospital or institution, we can join our local H&amp;I subcommittee. Perhaps we
can volunteer on the NA help line. Or we can give of our time, attention, and
love to a newcomer we are trying to help.</span></p>
