<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">February 20<BR><B>Powerlessness and
personal responsibility</B><BR><I>“Through our inability to accept
personal responsibilities, we were actually creating our own
problems.”</I><BR>Basic Text, p. 13<BR>––––=––––<BR>When
we refuse to take responsibility for our lives, we give away all of
our personal power. We need to remember that we are powerless over
our addiction, not our personal behavior.<BR>Many of us have misused
the concept of powerlessness to avoid making decisions or to hold
onto things we had outgrown. We have claimed powerlessness over our
own actions. We have blamed others for our circumstances rather than
taking positive action to change those circumstances. If we continue
to avoid responsibility by claiming that we are “powerless,” we
set ourselves up for the same despair and misery we experienced in
our active addiction. The potential for spending our recovery years
feeling like victims is very real.<BR>Instead of living our lives by
default, we can learn how to make responsible choices and take risks.
We may make mistakes, but we can learn from these mistakes. A
heightened awareness of ourselves and an increased willingness to
accept personal responsibility gives us the freedom to change, to
make choices, and to grow.<BR>––––=––––<BR><B>Just
for today:</B> My feelings, actions, and choices are mine. I will
accept responsibility for them.</P>
