<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">February 11<BR><B>A curse into a
blessing</B><BR><I>“We have become very grateful in the course of
our recovery.... We have a disease, but we do recover.”</I><BR>Basic
Text, p. 8<BR>––––=––––<BR>Active addiction was no
picnic; many of us barely came out of it alive. But ranting against
the disease, lamenting what it has done to us, pitying ourselves for
the condition it has left us in—these things can only keep us
locked in&nbsp;the spirit of bitterness and resentment. The path to
freedom and spiritual growth begins where bitterness ends, with
acceptance.<BR>There is no denying the suffering brought by
addiction. Yet it was this disease that brought us to Narcotics
Anonymous; without it, we would neither have sought nor found the
blessing of recovery. In isolating us, it forced us to seek
fellowship. In causing us to suffer, it gave us the experience needed
to help others, help no one else was so uniquely suited to offer. In
forcing us to our knees, addiction gave us the opportunity to
surrender to the care of a loving Higher Power.<BR>We would not wish
the disease of addiction on anyone. But the fact remains that we
addicts already have this disease—and further, that without this
disease we may never have embarked on our spiritual journey.
Thousands of people search their whole lives for what we have found
in Narcotics Anonymous: fellowship, a sense of purpose, and conscious
contact with a Higher Power. Today, we are grateful for everything
that has brought us this blessing.<BR>––––=––––<BR><B>Just
for today: </B>I will accept the fact of my disease, and pursue the
blessing of my recovery.</P>
