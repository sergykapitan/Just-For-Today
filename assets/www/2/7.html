<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">February 7<BR><B>This is not a
test</B><BR><I>“...we have found a loving, personal God to whom we
can turn.”</I><BR>Basic Text, p. 27<BR>––––=––––<BR>Some
of us come into recovery with the impression that life’s hardships
are a series of cosmic tests designed to teach us something. This
belief is readily apparent when something traumatic happens and we
wail, “My Higher Power is testing me!” We’re convinced that
it’s a test&nbsp;of our recovery when someone offers us drugs, or a
test of our character when faced with a situation where we could do
something unprincipled without getting caught. We may even think it’s
a test of our faith when we’re in great pain over a tragedy in our
lives.<BR>But a loving Higher Power doesn’t test our recovery, our
character, or our faith. Life just happens, and sometimes it hurts.
Many of us have lost love through no fault of our own. Some of us
have lost all of our material wealth. A few of us have even grieved
the loss of our own children. Life can be terribly painful at times,
but the pain is not inflicted on us by our Higher Power. Rather, that
Power is constantly by our sides, ready to carry us if we can’t
walk by ourselves. There is no harm that life can do us that the God
of our understanding can’t heal.<BR>––––=––––<BR><B>Just
for today:</B> I will have faith that my Higher Power’s will for me
is good, and that I am loved. I will seek my Higher Power’s help in
times of need.</P>
