7<BR>––––=––––<BR>Until we experience the healing
that happens when we work the Twelve Steps, it is doubtful that we
can find a statement more true than the quote above. Most of us come
to NA hanging our heads in shame, thinking about the past and wishing
we could go&nbsp;back and change it. Our fantasies and expectations
about the future may be so extreme that, on our first date with
someone, we find ourselves wondering which lawyer we’ll use for the
divorce. Almost every experience causes us to remember something from
the past or begin projecting into the future.<BR>At first, it’s
difficult to stay in the moment. It seems as though our minds won’t
stop. We have a hard time just enjoying ourselves. Each time we
realize that our thoughts are not focused on what’s happening right
now, we can pray and ask a loving God to help us get out of
ourselves. If we regret the past, we make amends by living
differently today; if we dread the future, we work on living
responsibly today.<BR>When we work the steps and pray each time we
discover we’re not living in the present, we’ll notice that those
times aren’t occurring as often as they used to. Our faith will
help us live just for today. We’ll have hours, even days, when our
full attention is focused on the current moment in time, not the
regrettable past or fearful future.<BR>––––=––––<BR><B>Just
for today:</B> When I live fully in each moment, I open myself to
joys that might otherwise escape me. If I am having trouble, I will
ask a loving God for help.</P>
