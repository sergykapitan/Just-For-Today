<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">February 4<BR><B>Feeling good isn’t
the point</B><BR><I>“For us, recovery is more than just
pleasure.”</I><BR>Basic Text, p. 43<BR>––––=––––<BR>In
our active addiction, most of us knew exactly how we were going to
feel from one day to the next. All we had to do was read the label on
the bottle or know what was in the bag. We planned our feelings, and
our goal for each day was to feel good.<BR>In recovery, we’re
liable to feel&nbsp;anything from one day to the next, even from one
minute to the next. We may feel energetic and happy in the morning,
then strangely let down and sad in the afternoon. Because we no
longer plan our feelings for the day each morning, we could end up
having feelings that are somewhat inconvenient, like feeling tired in
the morning and wide-awake at bedtime.<BR>Of course, there’s always
the possibility we could feel good, but that isn’t the point.
Today, our main concern is not feeling good but learning to
understand and deal with our feelings, no matter what they are. We do
this by working the steps and sharing our feelings with
others.<BR>––––=––––<BR><B>Just for today:</B> I will
accept my feelings, whatever they may be, just as they are. I will
practice the program and learn to live with my feelings.</P>
