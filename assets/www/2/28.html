gift</B><BR><I>“Our newly found faith serves as a firm foundation
for courage in the future.”</I><BR>Basic Text, p. 96<BR>––––=––––<BR>When
we begin coming to meetings, we hear other addicts talking about the
gifts they have received as a result of this program, things we never
thought of as gifts before. One such gift is the renewed ability to
feel the emotions we had deadened for so long with&nbsp;drugs. It’s
not difficult to think of love, joy, and happiness as gifts, even if
it’s been a long time since we’ve felt them. But what about “bad”
feelings like anger, sadness, fear, and loneliness? Such emotions
can’t be seen as gifts, we tell ourselves. After all, how can we be
thankful for things we want to run from?!<BR>We can become grateful
for these emotions in our lives if we place them in their proper
perspective. We need to remember that we’ve come to believe in a
loving Higher Power, and we’ve asked that Power to care for us—and
our Higher Power doesn’t make mistakes. The feelings we’re given,
“good” or “bad,” are given to us for a reason. With this in
mind, we come to realize that there are no bad feelings, only lessons
to be learned. Our faith and our Higher Power’s care give us the
courage we need to face whatever feelings may come up on a daily
basis.<BR>As we heard early in recovery, “Your Higher Power won’t
give you more than you can handle in just one day.” And the ability
to feel our emotions is one of the greatest gifts of
recovery.<BR>––––=––––<BR><B>Just for today:</B> I
will try to welcome my feelings, firm in the belief that I have the
courage to face whatever emotions may come up in my life.</P>
