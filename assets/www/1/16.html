feared that if we ever revealed ourselves as we were, we would surely
be rejected.... [But] our fellow members do understand us.”</I><BR>Basic
Text, p. 32<BR>––––=––––<BR>We need our fellow NA
members—their experience, their friendship, their laughter, their
guidance, and much, much more. Yet many of us hesitate to call our
sponsor or visit our NA friends. We don’t want to impose&nbsp;on
them. We think about phoning someone, but we don’t feel worthy of
their time. We fear that if they ever got to know us—really know
us—they’d surely reject us.<BR>We forget that our fellow NA
members are just like us. There’s nothing we’ve done, no place
we’ve been, no feeling we’ve felt that other recovering addicts
won’t be able to identify with. The more we let others get to know
us, the more we’ll hear, “You’re in the right place. You’re
among friends. You belong. Welcome!”<BR>We also forget that, just
as we need others, they need us. We’re not the only ones who want
to feel like we belong, who want to experience the warmth of
friendship, who want someone to share with. If we isolate ourselves
from our fellow members, we deprive them of something they need,
something only we can give them: our time, our company, our true
selves.<BR>In Narcotics Anonymous, recovering addicts care for one
another. What waits at the other end of the telephone is not
rejection, but the love, warmth, and identification of the NA
Fellowship. Make that call!<BR>––––=––––<BR><B>Just
for today:</B> In NA, I am among friends. I will reach out to others,
giving and receiving in fellowship.</P>
