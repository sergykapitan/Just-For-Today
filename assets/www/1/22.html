<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Basic Text p. 16<BR><BR>Learning in
recovery is hard work. The things we most need to know are often the
hardest to learn. We study recovery to prepare ourselves for the
experiences life will give us. As we listen to others share in
meetings, we take mental notes we can refer to later. Tobe prepared,
we study our notes and literature between &quot;lessons.&quot; Just
as students have the opportunity to apply their knowledge during
tests, so do we have the opportunity to apply our recovery during
times of crisis.<BR><BR>As always, we have a choice in how we will
approach life's challenges. We can dread and avoid them as threats to
our sereniW or we can gratefully accept them as opportunities for
growth. By confirming the principles we've learned in recovery,
life's challenges give us increased strength. Without such
challenges, however, we could forget what we've learned and begin to
stagnate. These are the opportunities that prod us to new spiritual
awakenings.<BR><BR>We will find that there is often a period of rest
after each crisis, giving us time to get accustomed to our new
skills. Once we've reflected on our experience, we are called on to
share our knowledge with someone who is studying what we've just
learned. In the school of recovery, all of us are teachers as well as
students.<BR><BR><B>Just for today:</B> I will be a student of
recovery. I will welcome challenges, confident in what I've learned
and eager to share it with others.</P>
