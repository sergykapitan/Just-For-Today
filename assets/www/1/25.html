We see it happening among us every day This miraculous turnabout is
evidence of a spiritual awakening.&quot; </I>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Basic Text p. 49&nbsp;<BR><BR>We watch
them walk in to their first meeting defeated, their spirits broken.
Their suffering is obvious, and their desire for help even more
apparent. They collect a welcome chip and go back to their seats,
shaken by the effort.<BR><BR>We see them again, and they seem a
little more comfortable. They've found a sponsor and are attending
meetings every night. They still won't meet our glance, but they nod
their heads in recognition as we share. We notice a spark of hope in
their eyes, and they smile uncertainly when we encourage them to keep
coming back.<BR><BR>A few months later, they are standing straight.
They've learned how to make eye contact. They're working the steps
with their sponsor and are healing as a result. We listen to them
sharing at meetings. We stack chairs with them afterward.<BR><BR>A
few years later, they are speaking at a convention workshop, They've
got a wonderful, humorous personality. They smile when they see us,
they hug us, and they tell us they could never have done it without
us. And they understand when we say, &quot;nor could we, without
you.&quot;<BR><BR><B>Just for today:</B> I will find joy in
witnessing the recovery of another.</P>
