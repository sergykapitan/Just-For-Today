addict</B><BR><I>“We can never fully recover, no matter how long we
stay clean.”</I><BR>Basic Text, p. 84<BR>––––=––––<BR>After
getting a little time in the program, some of us begin to think we
have been cured. We’ve learned everything NA has to teach us; we’ve
grown bored with the meetings; and our sponsor keeps droning the same
old refrain: “The steps—the steps—the steps!” We decide it is
time to get on with our lives, cut way back on meetings, and try to
make up for the years we have lost to active addiction. We do this,
however, at the peril of our recovery.<BR>Those of us who have
relapsed after such an episode often try to go to as many meetings as
we can—some of us go to a meeting every day for several years. It
may take that long for us to understand that we will always be
addicts. We may feel well some days and sick on other days, but we
are addicts every day. At any time, we are subject to delusion,
denial, rationalization, justification, insanity—all the hallmarks
of the typical addict’s way of thinking. If we want to continue
living and enjoying life without the use of drugs, we must practice
an active program of recovery each day.<BR>––––=––––<BR><B>Just
for today: </B>I am an addict every day, but today I have the choice
to be a recovering addict. I will make that choice by practicing my
program.</P>
