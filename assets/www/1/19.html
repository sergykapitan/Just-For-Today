99<BR>––––=––––<BR>Some of us seem to make mountains
out of molehills with our problems. Even those of us who’ve found
some measure of serenity have probably blown a problem far out of
proportion at some time in our recovery—and if we haven’t done so
yet, we probably will before long!<BR>When we find ourselves obsessed
with a complication in our lives, we will do well to sharply remind
ourselves of all that is going right. Perhaps we’re afraid we won’t
be able to pay our bills for the month. Instead of sitting at the
calculator, adding our financial liabilities over and over, we can
take stock of our efforts to reduce expenses. Following this
mini-inventory, we continue with the task at hand and remind
ourselves that as long as we are doing the footwork, a loving Higher
Power will care for our lives.<BR>Mountain-sized problems happen
sometimes, but we don’t need to create them. Trust in a loving God
of our understanding will put most of our problems in their proper
perspective. We no longer need to create chaos to feel excited about
our lives. Our recovery gives us countless real-life opportunities
for excitement and drama.<BR>––––=––––<BR><B>Just for
today</B>: I will take a realistic look at my problems and see that
most of them are minor. I will leave them that way and enjoy my
recovery.</P>
