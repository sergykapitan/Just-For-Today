As we realize our need to be forgiven, we tend to be more forgiving.
At least we know that we are no longer intentionally making life
miserable for people.&quot;</I><BR>Basic Text, p. 38&nbsp;<BR><BR>In
our addiction we often treated others badly, sometimes deliberately
finding ways to make their lives miserable. in our recovery, we may
still have a tendency to pass judgment on others' actions because we
think we know how that person should behave. But as we progress in
our recovery we often find that, to accept ourselves, we must accept
those around us.<BR><BR>It may be difficult to watch as someone's
insanity manifests itself. But if we detach ourselves from the
problem, we can start living in the solution. And if we feel affected
by another's actions, we can extend the principle of
forgiveness.<BR><BR><B>Just for today:</B> I will strive to forgive
rather than be forgiven. I will try to act in such a way that I feel
worthy of self-love.</P>
