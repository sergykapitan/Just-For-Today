Our understanding of a Higher Power is up to us.... The only
suggested guidelines are that this Power be loving, caring, and
greater than ourselves.&quot;</I><BR>Basic Text, p. 24<BR><BR>We've
been told that we can believe in any kind of Higher Power we want as
long as it is loving and, of course, greater than ourselves. Some of
us, however, have trouble with these requirements. We eitherbelieve
in nothing but ourselves, or we believe that anything that could be
called &quot;God&quot; could only be cold-hearted and unreasonable,
sending us bad luck on a whim.<BR><BR>Believing in a loving Power is
quite a leap for some of us, for many reasons. The thought of turning
our will and lives over to the care of something we think might hurt
us is sure to fill us with reluctance. If we come into the program
believing that God is judgmental and unforgiving, we must overcome
those beliefs before we can be truly comfortable with the Third
Step.<BR><BR>Our positive experiences in recovery can help us come to
believe in a loving God of our own understanding. We have been given
relief from a disease that has afflicted us for a long time. We've
found the guidance and support we need to develop a new way of life.
We've begun to experience a fullness of spirit where once there was
only emptiness. These aspects of our recovery have their source in a
loving God, not a harsh, hateful one. And the more we experience
recovery, the more we'll trust that loving Higher Power.<BR><BR><B>Just
for today:</B> I will open my mind and my heart to believe that God
is loving, and trust my loving Higher Power to do for me what I
cannot do for myself.</P>
