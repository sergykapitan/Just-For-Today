Faith</B><BR><BR><I>&quot; As we develop faith in our daily lives, we
find that our Higher Power supplies us with the strength and guidance
that we need.&quot;</I><BR><BR>Basic Text, p. 91 Some of us come into
recovery very frightened and insecure. We feel weak and alone. We are
uncertain of our direction and don't know where to go for answers. We
are told that if we find some faith in a Power greater than
ourselves, we will find security and guidance. We want that feeling
of safety and strength. But faith doesn't come overnight. It takes
time and effort to grow.<BR><BR>The seed is planted when we ask our
Higher Power for help and then acknowledge the source of our help
when it comes. We nurture the tiny seed of faith with the sunlight of
our prayers each day. Our faith grows, a reward for living life on
its own terms. One day we realize our faith has become like a huge
spreading tree; it doesn't stop the storms of life, but we know that
we are safe in its shelter.<BR><BR><B>Just for today:</B> I know that
faith in my Higher Power will not calm the storms of life, but it
will calm my heart. I will let my faith shelter me in times of
trouble.</P>
